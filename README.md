# RPG Styled UI
Foundry VTT DnD5e RPG Styled UI

A simple styling for FoundryVTT in black and red. Includes:
- Chat layout.
- Dialog Boxes Layout
- Character Sheet
- NPC Sheet
- Integration with [Combat Carousel](https://github.com/death-save/combat-carousel-public)

Originally made it for a campaign I run for friends and thought to make it commercial later on, but...
I'm so grateful to all the developers of free modules for Foundry, so I decided to release completely free.
